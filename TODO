### Items instock
Ur brokkie, Noob.

### Planning project
building Opencv Floorball detection
Get minimun aluminium bars and other hardware parts to build prototype
configure the motor, board and hardware to move to desire location with mouse cords.
Build full prototype Model. Test all aspects with Tracker
Order remaining hardware items to finish the build
Final Test of full workings machine
finish design, clean code, #seleton version
Last test of Skeleton version 01 of BOT
